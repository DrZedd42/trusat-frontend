          TruSat is an experimental technology demonstration of an open source
          toolset for assessing satellite operations against space
          sustainability standards. Space sustainability is about preserving the
          use of outer space, and all of its socioeconomic benefits, for present
          and future generations. As a practical matter, this means mitigating
          orbital debris, which can render orbits around Earth unusable for
          generations. Amid projections of a tenfold increase in the number of
          satellites in low Earth orbit (“LEO”), avoiding collisions between
          satellites is an increasingly urgent focus for space sustainability,
          and enlightened satellite operators, governments, and civil society
          are working to define standards for sustainable orbital operations. A
          crucial gap in these efforts is the absence of an open, widely-trusted
          source of data about the orbital position of satellites accessible for
          use in assessing compliance with sustainability standards. Section II
          of this white paper surveys the space sustainability landscape and
          situates TruSat within it.
